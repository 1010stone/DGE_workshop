# Differential gene expression workshop

This repository has teaching materials for a **1-day**, hands-on **Introduction to differential gene expression (DGE) analysis** workshop. The workshop will lead participants through performing a differential gene expression analysis workflow on RNA-seq count data using R/RStudio. Working knowledge of R is required or completion of the [Introduction to R workshop](https://github.com/hbctraining/Intro-to-R).

### Learning Objectives

- QC on count data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and heirarchical clustering
- Using DESeq2 to obtain a list of significantly different genes
- Visualizing expression patterns of differentially expressed genes
- Performing functional analysis on gene lists with R-based tools

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.
